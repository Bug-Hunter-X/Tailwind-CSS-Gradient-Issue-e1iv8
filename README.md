# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients.  The gradient is not rendering as expected, and shows only a single color. This issue might arise from various causes, including incorrect syntax, conflicting styles, or missing dependencies. 

## Problem Description
The provided code snippet aims to create a div element with a gradient background transitioning from blue to purple. However, instead of a smooth gradient transition, only a solid color is displayed.  This could be due to a missing or incorrect configuration setting, or a conflict with other CSS rules.
